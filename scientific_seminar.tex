% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option, it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000 thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms. You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of algorithmic.sty can be obtained at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at: http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable) algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty) set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/

%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools, especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.

%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later  (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/

%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in such ways.

%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls' captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument, so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway) and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption. The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a  page by themselves.

Classic, relational, SQL databases have proven their reliability, and versatility, in many different scenarios, over the past few decades. However wide their field of application may be though, there are still many situations, where one can be limited, by the constraints, of these traditional data structures. Efficiently querying very large user databases is one such situation. In this work, we are going to investigate a different paradigm for  big data management: Graph Databases. This relatively new breed of data management systems are already finding wide acceptance, and are being actively deployed across many industries. Use cases such as social media applications come to mind, where scalability is of prime importance, since datasets could theoretically achieve infinite dimensions. In this work, we will compare Graph, NoSQL databases, their strengths, and weaknesses, to classic, relational SQL databases.

\section{Introduction}
One may commence by presenting the main issue with classic, SQL databases. It is the exponential way in which hardware requirements scale up with the amount of data stored. This means that it becomes exponentially more challenging to maintain speed, RAM and storage amounts within reasonable constraints, as the amount of data increases. \par
Let us therefore introduce NoSQL databases. The main difference between these, and SQL databases, is how they scale. While SQL databases scale \textit{vertically}, NoSQL databases scale \textit{horizontally}. Specifically, it is the BASE (Basically Available State and Eventually Consistent) property of NoSQL databases which enables them to be a perfect choice for very large, connected, amounts of data. \par
For the purpose of this paper, we shall consider the term \textit{relational} database (RDBMS) as synonymous to \textit{SQL} database, and the term \textit{NoSQL} database as equivalent to \textit{Graph} database, unless other specified. As such, the respective pairs of terms will be used interchangeably. \par
It has been proved in research literature, as well as by the industry, that Graph databases perform radically better than relational databases for big data applications. This is especially true in scenarios where one can use the connected nature of data to their advantage. One prominent example of this is how Neo4j (NoSQL) performs much better than Oracle 11g (SQL). \par
However, let us not forget that Graph databases are not the only kind of NoSQL database out there. In fact, there are four types in total. Let us therefore examine these in detail.
\subsection{Types of NoSQL Databases}
There are four different kinds of NoSQL databases. Their properties and use scenarios depend on the needs and requirements of the applications in which they are used. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Key-Value}: these are, essentially, hash tables, where only unique hash keys are used to search for and point to specific values; the contents themselves are not used during queries.
	\item \textbf{Document}: Data is stored as a key/value tuple, and both the content, as well as the \textit{key} are used for searches, which constitutes a major difference from the type above. Documents of this type can be stored in XML, JSON and BSON formats, and popular apps using this type of database include MongoDB and CouchDB.
	\item \textbf{Wide-Column}: These databases are made unique by the hybrid approach used to store data. In this scenario, which is mainly used in \textit{cluster environments} and for distributed data, we will combine the features of relational databases with a key-value storage schema. Examples such as Hbase, Cassandra and Accumulo spring to mind.
	\item \textbf{Graph}: This type is used where the data has a high degree of connectivity, since such databases can naturally store relationships between Independent pieces of data. Examples include Neo4j, Pregel, ArrangoDB and OrientDB. 
\end{itemize}
Actual examples, together with actual package names, query languages and properties, can be found in \textit{Table \ref{table_types_nosql}}.

\subsection{Relational Database Design Optimization}
Let us look into how the performance of classic databases can be optimized. To this end, a process called \textit{tuning} can be involved. For instance, to improve the query performance of \textit{Oracle 11g} tables, we can use different tablespaces for each individual schema.  This results in more than one data file used for storage, which in turn allows us to optimize the size of memory blocks used. This is useful, since both small and large memory block sizes can be desirable, depending on the scenario. For example, \textit{warehouse type} data requires large memory blocks, whereas for \textit{OLTP} type data, we are required to use small block sizes. The total space allocation in a file is defined as an \textit{extent}, whereas one unit of I/O data is referred to as a \textit{block}. 
The ACID (Atomicity, Consistency Isolation, Durability) property of SQL databases helps maintain consistency across the data, and enables efficient polling and querying, but even this is eventually overcome by the sheer size of modern databases for online, user-generated content. \par
Even if SQL databases store data in separate tables, and normalization techniques, such as 1NF, 2NF and 3NF, can be used to reduce redundancy, this method remains unsuitable for modern applications. For instance, although it is possible to \textit{join} queries when searching a SQL databases for entries, this too becomes inefficient when using 20 or more parameters. \par

\section{State of the Art}
In this section, we shall look into, and compare, the different properties of SQL and NoSQL databases. For starters, let us revisit the scalability issue. As previously discussed, the more varied and larger the amount of data present in a SQL database, the more CPU and RAM a system will need. This is because relational databases scale \textit{vertically}, in contrast to NoSQL databases, which scale \textit{horizontally}. SQL databases are traditionally a good fit for applications where data integrity and security are important, since cryptolographic procedures and information security can be more easily implemented in such a scenario. NoSQL databases, however, are a great fit for very large, and growing, datasets, because they allow us to, for instance, add extra servers to an existing system with minimal intervention. \par

\section{Methods and Contributions}
Let us, for this section, start by introducing Eric Brewer's \textit{CAP Theorem} - Consistency, Availability and Partition Tolerance. A term by term analysis looks as follows: \textit{Consistency} describes the property of a system of achieving a \textit{stable state}, after one (or more) \textit{write} operations. \textit{Availability} describes data, namely it being present and ready for \textit{read} operations at one desired spot, after having been modified (right there or somewhere else). \textit{Partition Tolerance} refers to a system's ability to continue functioning, even if its resources are spread over different locations and nodes. Relational databases traditionally possess all 3 properties, whereas NoSQL databases (depending on the implementation) customarily only use the \textit{A} and \textit{P} parts.\par
In relational databases, primary keys are used to ensure that data is \textit{unique} - exists in one single location. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, due to their distributed nature, have no such limitation, and are therefore much more flexible and responsive to the changes one would experience in a connected system, for instance. Moreover, tracking interaction between different objects is much easier in this scenario. \par

\subsection{Direct Acyclic Graphs}
Let us now investigate why this kind of graph 

\subsection{Database Design Tuning}
In this subsection, we shall make a small detour, and examine why tuning relational databases is so important, any why one should always consider doing it, both when deploying a product, and when running benchmarks on standard data to determine speed. \par

\section{Results}
\subsection{Comparisons of SQL and NoSQL Products}
In the following subsections, we shall analyze and compare several \textit{competing} database types in a similar scenario.

Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here") positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.

\section{Conclusion}
Having now accomplished what we set out to do - namely to present a thorough analysis, and comparison, of the two most common types of databases in use throughout industries in this day and age, let us now deliver the closing remarks and present future directions of research we consider relevant for undertaking. \par
Firstly, it is widely accepted that NoSQL, Graph databases are the desirable way to store data  when systems are distributed and when flexibility, and redundancy, are needed. Such fields as online shops, social media, or some remote working tools rely on this type of system architectures, in order to ensure responsiveness, and reliable operation for multi-user collaboration. Further development and standardization of such systems could potentially open the doors to increased efficiency and reduced costs across the industry. \par
On the other hand, relational databases still play a very important role for centralized, high-value or mission-critical data. It is only with this type of database that one can ensure the reliable storage of such information as medical records, employment and financial histories, or voter registrations. Future research in this area could involve the development of even more sophisticated file systems, optimized for fast flash storage, or increasing information security by means of tightening standards for advanced encryption and by rolling out more and more granular access control. \par 
Moreover, let us once more stress the fact that we do not assert the superiority of either database type over the other. We remain strongly convinced that both have their own strengths and weaknesses, which one only needs be aware of when making the choice about which best suits their needs. \par
Finally, after having illustrated the differing aspects of relational and NoSQL databases, and after having delivered our thoughts on the direction of future research, we shall now declare this work closed.

%\begin{biography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:

%\begin{IEEEbiography}{Michael Shell}
%Biography text here.
%\end{IEEEbiography}

% if you will not have a photo at all:
%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Doe}
%Biography text here.
%\end{IEEEbiographynophoto}

% insert where needed to balance the two columns on the last page with
% biographies
%\newpage

%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{Jane Doe}
%Biography text here.
%\end{IEEEbiographynophoto}

% You can push biographies down or up by placing a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is on the last page and whether or not the columns are being equalized.

%\vfill

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one is flush with the other column.
